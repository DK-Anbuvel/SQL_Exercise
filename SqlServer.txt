Sql Execution Order:-
    Sql does not execute queries in the same order they are written.
    This may often confuses, but the excute order is

From  --> identity the data source
Where --> fuilter rows
GroupBy -->group the data
Having -->filter groups
Select --> choose columns
OrderBy --> sort the result
Limit/offSet --> restrict rows
    

1) why can't use aggregate function in WHERE ?
      because WHERE executes before GROUP BY

2) why does ORDER BY allow aliases but WHERE doesn't ?
        ORDER BY executes after SELECT.

3) which executes first:WHERE or HAVING?
       WHERE filters rows,HAVING filters groups
