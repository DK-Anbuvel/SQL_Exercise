DENSE_RANK() ;-
-------------------\

In SQL, the DENSE_RANK() function is a window function that assigns a rank to each row in a result
set, without gaps in the ranking values. The ranking starts at 1 for the first row and 
increments by 1 for each subsequent row with the same rank, meaning there are no "gaps" in the 
sequence of ranks even if multiple rows have the same value.

Syntax:
DENSE_RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY <column(s)> ORDER BY <column(s)>)


PARTITION BY: (Optional) Divides the result set into partitions to which the DENSE_RANK() function 
is applied. If this clause is not specified, the entire result set is treated as a single partition.

ORDER BY: Specifies the column or columns that determine the order in which the ranks are 
assigned. The rows are ranked in the specified order.
