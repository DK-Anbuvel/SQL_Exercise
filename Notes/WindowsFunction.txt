DENSE_RANK() ;-
-------------------\

In SQL, the DENSE_RANK() function is a window function that assigns a rank to each row in a result
set, without gaps in the ranking values. The ranking starts at 1 for the first row and 
increments by 1 for each subsequent row with the same rank, meaning there are no "gaps" in the 
sequence of ranks even if multiple rows have the same value.

Syntax:
DENSE_RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY <column(s)> ORDER BY <column(s)>)


PARTITION BY: (Optional) Divides the result set into partitions to which the DENSE_RANK() function 
is applied. If this clause is not specified, the entire result set is treated as a single partition.

ORDER BY: Specifies the column or columns that determine the order in which the ranks are 
assigned. The rows are ranked in the specified order.


OFFSET FETCH():-
----------------
  The OFFSET and FETCH clauses are options of the ORDER BY clause.
  They use to allow to limit the number of rows returned 
  by a query.

  syntax:

  ORDER BY column_list [ASC |DESC]
OFFSET offset_row_count {ROW | ROWS}
FETCH {FIRST | NEXT} fetch_row_count {ROW | ROWS} ONLY

The OFFSET clause is mandatory, while the FETCH clause 
is optional. Additionally, FIRST and NEXT are synonyms
and can be used interchangeably. Similarly, you can 
use ROW and ROWS interchangeably.
