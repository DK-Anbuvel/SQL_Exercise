What is difference between != and <> operators in Sql Server?

Since both are used as not operator.
 E.g :
select * from TableName where ColName <> value
select * from TableName where ColName != value

ans:-

There is no difference. You can use both in MSSQL.

The MSSQL doc says:

!= functions the same as the <> (Not Equal To) comparison operator.

But <> is defined in the ANSI 99 SQL standard and != is not.
 So not all DB engines may support it and if you want to generate portable code
 I recommend using <>.
